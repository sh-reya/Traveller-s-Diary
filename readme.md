An insight to the mini project.
This is a mini-project of front end web designing, where basically I tried to show
the high end use of html, bootstrap. The goal was to create a professional looking
website that had good graphics.
The image and the information has been taken from Google. I have tried to
inculcate all the information to give it a worthy presentation.
